It is a dark time for the People at

CDG. Although they had vaccations, it

was very boring. One of them, Master 

Lars, had the idea of creating a game. 

First it was a little project for

school, but he soon discovered, that his

coding skills were not good enough. So

he decided to get some help with this

and asked his friend Josh, who was very

interested in the idea. So they decided

to split work into the following:
 

Lars: Sprites, Design & Sounds

Josh:  Programming



        Special Thanks
